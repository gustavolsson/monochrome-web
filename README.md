A small Chrome extension that when enabled converts all text to either black or white to maximize contrast

---

To maximize contrast, this extension converts all text to either black, white or white with black borders depending on the background. Besides this, it does not alter the page in any way.

This extension may be helpful for people with limited eyesight or for computers with low-contrast screens.
